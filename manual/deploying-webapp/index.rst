Deploying your webapp on Hasura
===============================

Hasura provides a fast and simple way to deploy your app built on your favourite
frameworks as a service on a secure https subdomain. To deploy your code on
Hasura, all you need to do is a ``git push hasura master``!

To set up this simple git push deployment system, you need the following:

* Your app code in a git repository
* A Dockerfile that contains instructions on building a Docker image for your app
* A git-push deployment enabled service on Hasura

There are two ways of doing this:

* Use the Hasura Quickstart Templates that have "hello world" for a various framesworks
* Use your own Dockerfile


Option 1: Using the Quickstart Templates
----------------------------------------

Apps or Services deployed on Hasura run on Docker images, built according to a
Dockerfile. We've prepared `starter kits <https://github.com/hasura/quickstart-docker-git>`__ for all your favourite
frameworks, that already contain pre-configured Dockerfiles for you to quickly
setup your app!

Step 0: Create a hasura project
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Make sure you've create a Hasura project via dashboard.hasura.io.
Let's say your project is called `<project-name>`

Step 1: Install `hasuractl`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The easiest way to use these templates is to install and set your project
context on Hasuractl as shown in :doc:`../../ref/cli/hasuractl`.

Before you continue, remember to login and set-context so that `hasuractl` knows the name
of your hasura project.

.. code-block:: console

   $ hasuractl login
   $ hasuractl set-context <project-name>

Step 2: Check if your framework is in the quickstart list
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: console

    $ hasuractl quickstart list
    INFO Checking for network connection
    INFO Updating from https://github.com/hasura/quickstart-docker-git
    Available quickstart templates:
    csharp-aspnet
    elasticsearch
    go-iris
    go-raw
    haskell-spock
    java-play
    java-spark
    java-spring-boot
    joomla
    js-angularjs
    mysql
    nginx
    nodejs-express
    nodejs-express-sass
    php-apache
    php-laravel
    python-django
    python-flask
    r-shiny
    ruby-rails
    serverless-functions
    swift-perfect
    swift-vapor
    wordpress


This will show you a list of all supported quickstart templates. If your
favourite framework is missing from this list, drop us a message at
support@hasura.io, and we'll add it within a few hours!

Step 3: Initialise your app folder and git repo
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Choose a template, and use the following command to create your app folder
called <app-name>

.. code-block:: console

    $ hasuractl quickstart <template-name> <app-name> --create

For example, to create a folder and a subdomain app called `my-app` based on `python-flask`:

.. code-block:: console

    $ hasuractl quickstart python-flask my-app --create

This command will do the following:

* Create a service hosted at `my-app.<project-name>.hasura-app.io`, to which you can deploy your app
* Create a folder called `my-app`, that contains a Dockerfile with instructions on building your app
* Copy a hello world app written in the chosen framework (`python-flask`) into the <app-name> (`my-app`) directory

Now, `cd` into the folder, commit your code, and get ready to deploy!

.. code-block:: console

    $ cd <app-name>
    $ git commit -am "Initialized"

Step 4: Add your SSH key
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Make sure to add your ssh-key to your Hasura project before you deploy:

.. code-block:: console

    $ hasuractl add-ssh-key

Read :ref:`add-SSH-keys` for more info.

Step 5: Deploy your app
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Now, we deploy our app using:

.. code-block:: console

    $ git push hasura master

Voila, your service is deployed and live! Check out your service live at <app-name>.<project-name>.hasura-app.io!

In case there are any errors in building or deploying your code, the git push command will show you errors and the push will fail. Fix the error, and push again!

.. admonition:: Behind The Scenes

   The Hasura platform basically builds a docker image from the latest git changes
   pushed by you, and deploys the right kubernetes service, deployment underneath.

   If you want finer control over your deployment, you are encouraged to use ``kubectl``
   and peek under the hood of the service that is automatically deployed.


Option 2: Using your own Dockerfile (advanced users)
----------------------------------------------------

Create a git-push enabled service on the Hasura console
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Go to the ``Custom Microservices`` section of the Hasura console, select ``Git Push`` and create a git-push enabled service, and you're good to go.

For reference, here's a configuration screenshot:

.. rst-class:: featured-image
.. image:: ../../img/gitpush.png
   :scale: 50%


Add your SSH key
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Please see :ref:`add-SSH-keys` for instructions on how to create and add your SSH key to a Hasura project.


Deploy to your git-push enabled service
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once a git-push enabled custom service has been added on the hasura console,
you must first set the hasura remote by following the instructions shown on the
manage page of your git-push service.

.. code-block:: console

   $ git remote add hasura ssh://hasura@<git-push-service-name>.<project-domain>.hasura-app.io:2022/~/git/<git-push-service-name>/

After adding the remote, you can commit your changes and push to the hasura
remote to instantly build and deploy your app in one command!

.. code-block:: console

   $ git push hasura master

Voila, your service is deployed and live! Check out your service live at <app-name>.<project-name>.hasura-app.io!

In case there are any errors in building or deploying your code, the git push command will show you errors and the push will fail. Fix the error, and push again!
