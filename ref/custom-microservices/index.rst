Custom Microservices
====================
Custom microservices are services that are deployed by developers on Hasura using a git push command or by using one of the thousands of `Docker images <https://hub.docker.com/explore/>`__ or build and use their own images.


You can create and manage your own microservices in a Hasura project.
